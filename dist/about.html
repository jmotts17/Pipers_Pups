          Piper's Pups isn't just a solo act, it involves our whole family. Each
          of us has a specific role in making sure our puppies are ready to
          become the next member of your family. From the oldest, Kenny, to his
          younger sister, Chloe, to Clarke and the baby of the family, Claire.
          Each child spends time with the puppies ensuring they have plenty of
          time with people of all ages.

        </h2>
        <p class="section-content au1">
          We got Piper in 2017 to add to our family of 5 at the time. Piper made
          a wonderful impact as she taught our kids responsibility and showed
          them unconditional love as only a dog can. Fast forward to 2018, the
          Schaaap Family has now grown to a total of 8 with 4 skids and 2 dogs.
          Piper had her first litter in the Summer of 2018. She had 6 adorable
          Whoodle puppies. We could not help but keep one of her first puppies,
          Prim.
        </p>
        <p class="section-content au2">
          Having 4 kids and 2 puppies, there is always activity going on in the
          Schaap home. Each puppy is shown much love and attention from all of
          our kids. Towards the end of their 8 week stay, we begin to let them
          play outside. This allows the puppies to have a great balance from the
          beginning which in turn helps them to have the wonderful temperament
          that Whoodles are known to have.
        </p>
        <p class="section-content au3">
          We make sure each of our puppies are given special attention as proper
          socialization is extremely important to a dogs temperament.
          Additionally, each of our puppies health is very important to us. We
          take the puppies to the vet regularly to be sure each of them is
          developing properly and healthy. Each puppy will include their first
          round of shots, a bag of food, a toy and a blanket with the scent of
          their mother.
