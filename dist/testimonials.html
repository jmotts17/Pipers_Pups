              <blockquote>My wife and I got our first puppy from Ken and Candace. We've had Finn just over a year and could not be happier to have adopted a Whoodle as our first puppy. Finn is full of energy and always ready to play. He is very friendly and all our neighbors love him. Piper's Pups takes great care of each puppy until the day of adoption. We hope to get Finn a brother or sister sometime in the future! Thank you Ken and Candace!</blockquote>

                <blockquote>This is Roscoe. We adopted him in April from Piper's Pups. Candace takes such good care of the puppies with individual records on each of them. They get shots, physical and dew claw removal. Roscoe is such a joy, he loves people and other animals. People are always asking what kind of dog is he. Who could resist that face!</blockquote>

                <blockquote>Candace, we are in LOVE! We went to see the Vet on Tuesday afternoon, and the Vet almost stole them. Dr Stevens spent over an hour with them, checking them but mostly playing with them and loving on them. She was so impressed! Loved their temperaments and how healthy they are. Thought they were so beautiful and just perfect! She did little personality and intelligence play tests with each and said they are the best pups she’s seen in ages.
                    — I see potential for becoming a Whoodle hoarder.</blockquote>
